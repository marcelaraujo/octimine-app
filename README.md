# octimine PHP Test 2016

The purpose of this test is to evaluate your proficiency in PHP.

Altough one of the requirements is to build on top of Laravel, if you have no experience with MVC frameworks but still try to perform the test, the effort will help you to get to the technical interview!

###Assessment

This is what we are trying to assess:

1. Your familiarity with PHP development tools as follows: 

* Composer
* Laravel
* MVC pattern
* OOP

2. Your code organization and cleanliness

### Development

We request you to build a very simple CRUD operation, comprising of:

1. Add a new record;
2. A list of records, which can be edited and removed (use two different buttons in the end of each row);
3. The list must be paginated, 5 records per page;
2. Edit a record, with notification message after the success of the operation;
3. Remove a record, with notification message after the success of the operation.

### Working and sending your work to us

To start your work fork this repository on your own machine. 

When your job is finished send us a pull request so we can evaluate what you've built! 

This is also part of the test. =)

### Additional details

1. In order to make the final result look better you're allowed (if not encouraged) to use a frontend framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation;

2. For the database structure create what you think best suits the kind of application you're building;

3. The database tables must be built by migrations.

### Deadline

Please do it in no more than a day.
